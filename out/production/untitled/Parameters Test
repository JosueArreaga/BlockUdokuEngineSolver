Intro: The purpose of this test is to improve our parameters. We run a total of 1000 games with the following parameters.
We then try to maximize our result by storing the 1000 game results in the Results Array. Then We construct a normal curve
to find our mean, standard deviation, mode and such.




Code to test:

        int testNumber = 0;
        int [] results = new int[1000];

        while(true) {
            Board board = new Board();
            Logic logic = new Logic(board);
            PieceGenerator pGenerator = new PieceGenerator();
            Piece piece;
            int counter = 1;

            while (!logic.isGameOver()){
                System.out.println("Round: " + counter);
                piece = pGenerator.getRandomPiece();
                logic.newTurn(piece);
                counter++;
            }

            results[testNumber] = counter;
            testNumber++;
            if(testNumber == 1000)
                break;
        }

        for (int result : results) {
            System.out.printf(result + ",");
        }

    Notice: each round now has 3 moves as opposed to only one
    Results: Mean = 64.58, SD = 48.13

    Conclusion: If we count 3 * 64.58 our new mean in comparison with the previous equals 193.75.
    This is an increment of 372% from a mean of 52.
